### Hi there, I'm Amarachi Shulammite Aso ðŸ‘‹

#### Happy to see you here!

I'm a junior fullstack developer.  Although i currently have more experience on the frontend, i have workable
knowledge of backend development and clound computing, and eagearly improving my skill in all, one step at a time.

I find getting to the root of problems and solving them really satisfying. I especially love working with javaScript and it's ecosytem, but i'm happy and looking to find another love too; I Know and believe programming languages are just tools.

 ## My current tech stack include:
- HTML/CSS 
- JavaScript 
- React 
- Typescript
- Redux
- JQuery
- NodeJS
- Express
- MongoDB
- Docker
- Linux/shell
- Material UI
- Tailwind
- React-bootstrap
- Bootstrap

### More about me
- I currently work partime on the frontend at [Mizala](https://mizala.co/)  

- I'm also actively working on a [journaling app](https://github.com/Shulammite-Aso/Journal-app-frontend) as a personal project.

- I have a small api i initially built for it [here](https://github.com/Shulammite-Aso/Journaling-app-api), but it now needs more than i have here, so i'm starting to do more work on this too.
