### Hi there, I'm Amarachi Shulammite Aso ðŸ‘‹

#### Happy to see you here!

I'm a junior fullstack developer.  Although i currently have more experience on the frontend, i have workable
knowledge of backend development and clound computing, and eagearly improving my skill in all, one step at a time.

I find getting to the root of problems and solving them really satisfying. I especially love working with javaScript and it's ecosytem, but i'm happy and looking to find another love too; I Know and believe programming languages are just tools.

 ## My current tech stack include:
- HTML/CSS 
- JavaScript 
- React 
- Typescript
- Redux
- JQuery
- NodeJS
- Express
- MongoDB
- Docker
- Linux/shell
- Material UI
- Tailwind
- React-bootstrap
- Bootstrap

### More about me
- I currently work partime on the frontend at [Mizala](https://mizala.co/)  

- I'm also actively working on a [journaling app](https://github.com/Shulammite-Aso/Journal-app-frontend) as a personal project.

- I have a small api i initially built for it [here](https://github.com/Shulammite-Aso/Journaling-app-api), but it now needs more than i have here, so i'm starting to do more work on this too, so that i can connect the frontend to it.

- I also like contributing to open-source. I'm looking to start making more time for it. If you'd like to let me know about an open source project being actively developed and is using my above tech stack, please do send me link to it. I have dropped my email in the next subheading.

## I'm available for Hire
If you'd like a junior software engineer on your team, whose's eager to quicky pick up skills and adapt to your teams fine culture, i'd be elated if you ask to hear from me.
