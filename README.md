### Hi there, I'm Amarachi Shulammite Aso ðŸ‘‹

#### Welcome to my profile!

Iâ€™m a software engineer, a diligent one. I have just transitioned to the backend side of engineering after working professionally on the frontend for a while. My current programming language of interest is Golang. In addition to it, Iâ€™m skilled in JavaScript, nodejs, and Typescript. Other technologies that I work with include: 
- Kubernetes
- Docker
- Linux/shell
- Postgres
- MongoDB
- Docker
- Terraform 
- GCP

## My Latest projects:
- [FILEBOX](https://github.com/Shulammite-Aso/filebox)
- [PIXELART](https://github.com/Shulammite-Aso/pixelArt)
- [GREPCLONE](https://github.com/Shulammite-Aso/grepclone)

## Open source

## Open to work.

Iâ€™m currently open to work as a backend software engineer. Iâ€™m also willing to work as a fullstack software engineer where backend is the primary focus. On the frontend i have worked extensively with React, React/Typescript, and Redux. Working with a team building developer tools will interest me the most. 
Please email me at asoamarachi@gmail.com if you think i might be a good fit for a job you know about.

#### Cheers âœ¨
