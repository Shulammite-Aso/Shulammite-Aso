### Hi there, I'm Amarachi Shulammite Aso ðŸ‘‹

#### Happy to see you here!

I'm a junior fullstack developer.  I currently have more experience on the frontend, however i have good
knowledge of backend development and workable knowledge of clound computing.

I find getting to the root of problems and working out solutions for them really satisfying. Honestly, only a few things are as satisfying as when you can finally tell why something is not working as it should, and then fixing it.

 ## My current tech stack include:
- HTML/CSS 
- JavaScript 
- Typescript
- Golang (Learning ðŸŽ‰)
- React
- Redux
- JQuery
- NodeJS
- Express
- MongoDB
- Docker
- Linux/shell
- GCP
- Material UI
- Tailwind
- React-bootstrap
- Bootstrap

### More about my dev Life
- I currently work as a consulting frontend engineer at [sterling bank](https://sterling.ng/) building the new [altmall](https://altmall.ng/)

- On the side, I do backend stuff at [Bleautech](https://www.bleautech.org/)

- I'm using my free time to work on a personal project: [Journaling-app-api](https://github.com/Shulammite-Aso/Journaling-app-api), an api for a journaling app i had casually worked on [here](https://github.com/Shulammite-Aso/Journal-app-frontend), all for for the purpose of picking up some skill or the other.

- I also like contributing to open-source. I'm looking to start making more time for it. If you'd like to let me know about an open source project being actively developed and is using my above tech stack, please do send me link to it. I have dropped my email in the next subheading.

## I'm available for Hire
