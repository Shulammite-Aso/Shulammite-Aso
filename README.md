### Hi there, I'm Amarachi Shulammite Aso ðŸ‘‹

#### Welcome to my profile!

I'm a software engineer who has built micro-services in Golang and other languages such as Nodejs and Nodejs/Typescript and deployed them in Kubernetes clusters. I have just transitioned to the backend and cloud platform side of engineering after working professionally on the frontend for a while. Currently, I work primarily with Golang. In addition to it, Iâ€™m skilled in JavaScript, Node.js, and Typescript. Other technologies that I work with include: 
 - Docker 
 - Kubernetes 
 - Linux/shell
 - GCP
 - Terraform
 - gRPC
 - MongoDB
 - Postgresql
 - MySQL
 - Redis
 - Reactjs and its ecosystem

I have a strong foundation that enables me to understand engineering problems, design and build solutions for them, and quickly pick up new skills on the job.

## Open to work.

Iâ€™m currently open to work as a backend software engineer. Iâ€™m also willing to work as a fullstack software engineer where backend is the primary focus. On the frontend i have worked extensively with React, React/Typescript, and Redux. Working with a team building developer tools will interest me the most. 
Please email me at asoamarachi@gmail.com if you think i might be a good fit for a job you know about.
