### Hi there, I'm Amarachi Shulammite Aso ðŸ‘‹

#### Welcome to my profile!

Iâ€™m a software engineer. A diligent one. Iâ€™m transitioning from the frontend to the backend side of engineering. My current programming language of interest is Golang. In addition to it, Iâ€™m skilled in JavaScript, nodejs, and Typescript. Other technologies that I work with include: 
- MongoDB
- Postgres
- Docker
- Linux/shell
- Terraform
- Kubernetes 
- GCP

## My Latest projects:

## Open source

## Open to work.

Iâ€™m currently open to work as a backend software engineer. Iâ€™m also willing to work as a fullstack software engineer where backend is the primary focus. On the frontend i have worked extensively with React, React/Typescript, Redux.

#### Cheers âœ¨
